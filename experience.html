      I worked for <a href="http://www.eftours.com/" target="_blank">EF Tours</a>, a division of <a href="http://www.ef.edu/" target="_blank">EF Education First</a> that sells educational tours to students and teachers around the world. EF aims to educate through cultural exchange and travel, so EF Tours is essential to the brand.<br><br>

      As a developer intern, I was embedded in a full-time team consisting of other developers, business analysts, and a UX designer. We developed a new tour consolidation web application using <strong>React/Redux</strong> and the <strong>C# .NET Framework</strong>, designed to be much more intuitive, user-friendly, and ultimately more efficient than the antiquated software that the company was still using.<br><br>

      Given that tour consolidation is a central part of EF Tours' operations and business model, upper management was particularly interested in our project and its potential to deliver enormous business value to EF. I had the opportunity to participate in the Scrum/Agile framework, working closely with various stakeholders.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.downdogapp.com/" target="_blank">Down Dog App</a> is a yoga app startup unique in that it does away with the static videos that its competitors use, and instead generates yoga sequences from a server. This allows the app to have endless content and customization, making it a true yoga studio experience.<br><br>

      As a software design engineering intern, I <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43279831/Down-Dog-App-UIUX-design" target="_blank">designed</a> several new features of the app using <strong>Sketch</strong>, and implemented the features on <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong>. I also designed several upcoming features for future implementation, including advanced settings, practice history, stats, and offline mode. Designing and implementing these features was essential to Down Dog App's freemium business model, as in order to acquire more paid users, freemium apps must add paid features; later users are always more difficult to convert than early users, so a freemium app needs to continually seek ways to add to its value proposition in order to see continued growth. One of my projects resulted in a spike in paid subscriptions.<br><br>

      In addition to designing and implementing new features, I adjusted the app's UI to be responsive for multiple screen sizes and completely redesigned Down Dog's website.<br><br>

      Brown Computer Science's TA program is an essential component of the department. Professors rely heavily on TA staff to help run their courses and answer students' needs.<br><br>

      As a TA for a large introductory course, I held weekly office hours, held weekly section to review lecture topics, graded homework and projects, mentored individual students, and discussed and implemented ways to improve the course with other TAs, students, and the professor.<br><br>

      I found being a TA to be one of the best ways to give back to the CS department and enrich student experience.<br><br>
