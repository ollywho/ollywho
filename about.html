  <h2 class="title">ABOUT</h2>
  <p class="single-column">
    My name is Oliver Hu and I am a senior at Brown University studying computer science and music. Last summer, I 
    interned at <a href="http://www.eftours.com/" target="_blank">EF Education First</a> as a full-stack developer, 
    where I worked on web development using React/Redux and the .NET framework. Before that, I interned at 
    <a href="http://downdogapp.com" target="_blank">Down Dog App</a>, where I worked on 
    <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/43279831/Down-Dog-App-UIUX-design" target="_blank">UI/UX design</a>, iOS 
    and Android development.<br><br>

    Aside from software development, I have a special interest in design and entrepreneurship. To me, design is all 
    about problem-solving. Good design manifests itself in solutions where every detail has purpose and intent, and 
    where function is valued over form with minimal sacrifice of elegance. It makes sense, then, that design and 
    entrepreneurship go hand-in-hand; the entrepreneur identifies the problem and creates an idea for a solution, 
    and the designer realizes the solution. In our increasingly technologized world, the software developer is 
    becoming an evermore vital third piece, being the one who implements the solution.<br><br>

    What I've described above is the way I approach software development, and the space that I desire to be a part 
    of. I believe that the combination of entrepreneurship, design, and software engineering yields creative 
    solutions to many real-world problems. As such, I tend to gravitate towards front-end development. I like to 
    gain a deeper understanding of the customer and end-user of my work, as well as the business model of the 
    organization that Iâ€™m working for.<br><br>

    In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, singing, songwriting, and arranging for my a cappella 
    group. I also dabble in photography and like to criticize bad design in everyday objects. My latest obsession 
    has been Scandinavian Minimalism, particularly in clothing design.
