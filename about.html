  <h2 class="title">ABOUT</h2>
  <p class="single-column">
    Hello! My name is Oliver Hu and I am a full-stack software engineer at Microsoft working on OneDrive/SharePoint, currently focusing on web UX development for SharePoint News and File Intelligence. Working on a product with over 200 million monthly active users, many of whom depend on it for their own work, I know just how important it is to empathize with the customer and think from the perspective of the user. Doing so is critical to delivering the best product and user experience possible, and more fun as well.<br></br>

    <!-- Aside from software development, I have a special interest in design and entrepreneurship. To me, design is all 
    about problem-solving. Good design manifests itself in solutions where every detail has purpose and intent, and 
    where function is valued over form with minimal sacrifice of elegance. It makes sense, then, that design and 
    entrepreneurship go hand-in-hand; the entrepreneur identifies the problem and creates an idea for a solution, 
    and the designer realizes the solution. In our increasingly technologized world, the software developer is 
    becoming an evermore vital third piece, being the one who implements the solution.<br><br>

    What I've described above is the way I approach software development, and the space that I desire to be a part 
    of. I believe that the combination of entrepreneurship, design, and software engineering yields creative 
    solutions to many real-world problems. As such, I tend to gravitate towards front-end development. I like to 
    gain a deeper understanding of the customer and end-user of my work, as well as the business model of the 
    organization that Iâ€™m working for.<br><br> -->

    In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar and piano, singing, and songwriting. I document my life through photography, and have fallen down the rabbit-hole of film photography in the last couple years. I also love to ski, scuba dive, and criticize bad design in everyday objects and interfaces.
